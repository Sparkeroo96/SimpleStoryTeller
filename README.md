# SimpleStoryTeller
For CO659 I will create a system that can automatically generate simple stories for a reader that
should have a plot that will make logical sense for a reader. These stories will create characters
with some measure of back story and history and they will advance through a series of events to
create a story. The events will be influenced by the backstories that will have been generated
for the characters in order to attempt to create a story that is relevant to the individuals involved
instead of a series of events that they are passengers in.

It will attempt to produce an output (story) that includes a degree of novelty each time it is run
and the events that happen in it should make sense and happen in a linear sequence of time.
(Gervais, n.d.). I will however place less emphasis on the semantics of the text and aim to work
on the story structure instead.

I will evaluate the program by seeing if the story makes sense to the reader and how obvious it
is that it was created by my hand instead of the system in question and that if the story was
written by an author with talent then the audience could become engaged with its contents.
However it could also be evaluated by a form of turing test, if we break another story down into
its key plot elements and have them displayed how the computer has would a person be able to
tell the difference. (Pease and Colton, n.d.) I I understand that this is not a perfect approach to
analysing intelligence or creativity and actually could just show an imitation of intelligence, but I
feel like whether or not a story is good is subjective and there for a subjective test should work
for it.

Samuel, 

Your idea can create a suitable project for the module, and I believe you can finish a working prototype in time. My recommendations are as follows:

1)     It was not clear to me how you’re going to approach the story structure to make sure that the output ‘makes sense’, meaning how the algorithm will make use of the backstory and time-dependent events. That seems to be the greatest challenge you face, so make sure to describe in your report what your approach was, and what you based it on.
2)     The evaluation part is also very important, as making the evaluation yourself can result in a biased evaluation. I’d recommend interviewing third parties (after you have an output that you deemed reasonable, but without changing or editing any of it) weigh in on how they would evaluate the story structure created by the algorithm.
3)     I would also recommend that you make some effort into the grammar/sentence structure as well, even though it is not your focus. You can apply some basic techniques we have worked with in class, that would greatly boost the quality of the generated text and make it easier to evaluate.
 
Finally, look into existing articles that try to solve similar problems, to get some insight. As a starting point, take a look at this:
